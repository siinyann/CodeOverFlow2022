        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the United Nations, climate change refers to long-term
          shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be
          natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the
          1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change,
          primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
          <br />
          <br />
          Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like
          a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and
          raising temperatures.
          <br />
          <br />
          Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change
          include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for
          driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing
          land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for
          garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry,
          transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main
          emitters.

        <h2>What are the effects of Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past 100 years, global temperatures have been increasing
          faster than ever before. As the Earth gets warmer, rain patterns are
          changing, sea levels are rising, and year after year, snow and ice are
          melting sooner each spring. The impact of climate change on the
          environment is becoming increasingly apparent as climate conditions
          continue to change and intensify.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and
          disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human
          beings and other forms of life on Earth.

              <p>
                Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020
                was one of the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase
                heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move
                around. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when
                conditions are hotter.

                Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This results in more
                severe and frequent storms. They cause flooding and landslides,
                destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of pounds.

                Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. Droughts can stir
                destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of
                sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for
                growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough

              <p>
                The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. This melts
                ice sheets and raises sea levels, threatening coastal and island
                communities. The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it from
                the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, which
                endangers marine life.

                Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in
                the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Forest fires,
                extreme weather and invasive pests and diseases are among many
                threats. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others
                will not.

                Changes in climate and increases in extreme weather events are among
                the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition.
                Fisheries crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less

                Extreme weather events increase disease and death, and make it
                difficult for health care systems to keep up. Other risks to health

                Much of our electricity and heat is powered by coal, oil and gas. Use
                less energy by lowering your heating and cooling, switching to LED
                light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, washing your
                laundry with cold water or hanging things to dry instead of using a

              <p>          
                The world’s roads are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning
                diesel or petrol. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will
                reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and help your health and fitness.
                For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. And carpool
                whenever possible.

                Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds,
                and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower your environmental
                impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer
