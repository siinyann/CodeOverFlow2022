        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the United Nations, climate change refers to long-term
          shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be
          natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the
          1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change,
          primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
          <br />
          <br />
          Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like
          a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and
          raising temperatures.
          <br />
          <br />
          Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change
          include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for
          driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing
          land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for
          garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry,
          transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main
          emitters.

        <h2>What are the effects of Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past 100 years, global temperatures have been increasing
          faster than ever before. As the Earth gets warmer, rain patterns are
          changing, sea levels are rising, and year after year, snow and ice are
          melting sooner each spring. The impact of climate change on the
          environment is becoming increasingly apparent as climate conditions
          continue to change and intensify.
          <br />
          <br />
          Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and
          disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human
          beings and other forms of life on Earth.
        </p>
        <h4>Hotter Temperatures</h4>
        <p>
          Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020
          was one of the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase
          heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move
          around. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when
          conditions are hotter.
        </p>
        <h4>More Severe Storms</h4>
        <p>
          Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This results in more
          severe and frequent storms. They cause flooding and landslides,
          destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of pounds.
        </p>
        <h4>Increased Drought</h4>
        <p>
          Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. Droughts can stir
          destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of
          sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for
          growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough
          water on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <h4>A Warming, Rising Ocean</h4>
        <p>
          The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. This melts
          ice sheets and raises sea levels, threatening coastal and island
          communities. The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it from
          the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, which
          endangers marine life.
        </p>
        <h4>Loss of Species</h4>
        <p>
          Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in
          the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Forest fires,
          extreme weather and invasive pests and diseases are among many
          threats. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others
          will not.
        </p>
        <h4>Not Enough Food</h4>
        <p>
          Changes in climate and increases in extreme weather events are among
          the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition.
          Fisheries crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less
          productive. Heat stress can diminish water and grasslands for grazing.
        </p>
        <h4>More Health Risks</h4>
        <p>
          Changing weather patterns are expanding diseases such as malaria.
          Extreme weather events increase disease and death, and make it
          difficult for health care systems to keep up. Other risks to health
          include increased hunger and poor nutrition in places where people
          cannot grow or find sufficient food.
        </p>
        <h4>Poverty and Displacement</h4>
        <p>
          Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in
          poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and
          livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs.
          Weather-related disasters displace 23 million people a year, leaving
          many more vulnerable to poverty.

        <h2>How to reduce the effects of Climate Change</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone can help limit climate change. From the way we travel, to the
          electricity we use and the food we eat, we can make a difference.
          Start with these ten actions to help tackle the climate crisis.
        </p>
        <h4>Save Energy at Home</h4>
        <p>
          Much of our electricity and heat is powered by coal, oil and gas. Use
          less energy by lowering your heating and cooling, switching to LED
          light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances, washing your
          laundry with cold water or hanging things to dry instead of using a
          dryer.
        </p>
        <h4>Walk, Cycle or Take Public Transport</h4>
        <p>
          The world’s roads are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning
          diesel or petrol. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving will
          reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and help your health and fitness.
          For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus. And carpool
          whenever possible.
        </p>
        <h4>Eat More Vegetables</h4>
        <p>
          Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds,
          and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower your environmental
          impact. Producing plant-based foods generally results in fewer
          greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land and water.
        </p>
        <h4>Consider Your Travel</h4>
        <p>
          Aeroplanes burn large amounts of fossil fuels, producing significant
          greenhouse gas emissions. That makes taking fewer flights one of the
          fastest ways to reduce your environmental impact. When you can, meet
          virtually, take a train or skip that long-distance trip altogether.
        </p>
        <h4>Throw Away Less Food</h4>
        <p>
          When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy
          that were used to grow, produce, package and transport it. And when
          food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse
          gas. So use what you buy and compost any leftovers.
        </p>
        <h4>Reduce, Reuse, Repair & Recycle</h4>
        <p>
          Electronics, clothes and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at
          each point in production, from the extraction of raw materials to
          manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect our
          climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair what you can and
          recycle.
        </p>
        <h4>Change Your Home's Source of Energy</h4>
        <p>
          Ask your utility company if your home energy comes from oil, coal or
          gas. If possible, see if you can switch to renewable sources such as
          wind or solar. Or install solar panels on your roof to generate energy
          for your home.
        </p>
        <h4>Switch To an Electric Vehicle</h4>
        <p>
          If you plan to buy a car, consider going electric, with more and
          cheaper models coming on the market. Even if they still run on
          electricity produced from fossil fuels, electric cars help reduce air
          pollution and cause significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions than
          petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.
