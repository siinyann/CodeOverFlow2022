        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>
          According to the United Nations, climate change refers to long-term
          shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be
          natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the
          1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change,
          primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
          <br />
          <br />
          Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like
          a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sunâ€™s heat and
          raising temperatures.
          <br />
          <br />
          Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change
          include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for
          driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing
          land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for
          garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry,
          transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main
          emitters.

        <h2>What are the effects of Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past 100 years, global temperatures have been increasing
          faster than ever before. As the Earth gets warmer, rain patterns are
          changing, sea levels are rising, and year after year, snow and ice are
          melting sooner each spring. The impact of climate change on the
          environment is becoming increasingly apparent as climate conditions
          continue to change and intensify.
          <br />
          <br />
          Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and
          disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human
          beings and other forms of life on Earth.
        </p>

      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>Hotter Temperatures</h4>
        <p>
          Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020
          was one of the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase
          heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move
          around. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when
          conditions are hotter.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>More Severe Storms</h4>
        <p>
          Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This results in more
          severe and frequent storms. They cause flooding and landslides,
          destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of pounds.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>Increased Drought</h4>
        <p>
          Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. Droughts can stir
          destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of
          sand across continents. Deserts are expanding, reducing land for
          growing food. Many people now face the threat of not having enough
          water on a regular basis.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>A Warming, Rising Ocean</h4>
        <p>
          The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. This melts
          ice sheets and raises sea levels, threatening coastal and island
          communities. The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it from
          the atmosphere. More carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, which
          endangers marine life.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>Loss of Species</h4>
        <p>
          Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in
          the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Forest fires,
          extreme weather and invasive pests and diseases are among many
          threats. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others
          will not.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>Not Enough Food</h4>
        <p>
          Changes in climate and increases in extreme weather events are among
          the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition.
          Fisheries crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less
          productive. Heat stress can diminish water and grasslands for grazing.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>More Health Risks</h4>
        <p>
          Changing weather patterns are expanding diseases such as malaria.
          Extreme weather events increase disease and death, and make it
          difficult for health care systems to keep up. Other risks to health
          include increased hunger and poor nutrition in places where people
          cannot grow or find sufficient food.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h4>Poverty and Displacement</h4>
        <p>
          Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in
          poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and
          livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs.
          Weather-related disasters displace 23 million people a year, leaving
          many more vulnerable to poverty.
